- Looking ahead: menial work computing fields from charge densities
- Integral volume element formulas

# Q3

- Looking ahead: I have a volume integral over $B^2$, which I need to compute as a function of $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{J}$ the magentic potentail and the current density.
- They said do integration by parts. so we'll use $B = \text{curl}(A)$
- Spent a lot of time on [[Tensor Analysis#Indexology]]

# Q2
- Got sideways with the differences between current and current density
	- $I$ is 1D current density
- Notice the power in the denominator for the inegrals (im mixing up 2 and 3)
- Flunked the first question completely:
	- Falsely deduced that the magnetic field is azimuthal only
	- Falsely interpreted the meaning of "enclosed current" in [[Maxwell Equations#^7d927f]]! The LHS is integrated over a loop of choice, and the enclosed current is the total current flux through the surface enclosed by this loop.
	- TODO: I used to have this result for [[Maxwell Equations#^7d927f]]  stating that a component of the field will vanish if there is some symmtery

- Q2.3 - forgot that the B-field must be continuous
