## Overview

The **calculus of variations** is a branch of mathematical analysis that deals with finding extrema (maxima, minima, or saddle points) of functionals. A **functional** is a mapping from a space of functions to the real numbers, often expressed in the form:

$$ J[y] = \int_{a}^{b} F(x, y(x), y'(x)) \, dx, $$

where \( y(x) \) is a function defined on \([a, b]\), and \( F(x, y, y') \) is a given function of \( x \), \( y(x) \), and \( y'(x) \). The goal is to determine the function \( y(x) \) that makes \( J[y] \) an extremum, subject to certain boundary conditions.

## Fundamental Problem

The fundamental problem of the calculus of variations can be stated as follows:

1. **Given**: A functional \( J[y] \), where
   $$ J[y] = \int_{a}^{b} F(x, y(x), y'(x)) \, dx, $$
   and boundary conditions \( y(a) = y_a \) and \( y(b) = y_b \).

2. **Find**: The function \( y(x) \) that minimizes (or maximizes) \( J[y] \).

## Euler-Lagrange Equation

A necessary condition for \( y(x) \) to be an extremum of \( J[y] \) is that it satisfies the **Euler-Lagrange equation**:

$$ \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial y'} \right) = 0. $$

This differential equation must hold for all \( x \in [a, b] \) where \( y(x) \) is smooth and satisfies the prescribed boundary conditions.

## Examples and Applications

1. **Shortest Path (Geodesics)**: Finding the curve of shortest distance between two points on a surface.
2. **Brachistochrone Problem**: Determining the curve along which a particle slides under gravity in the shortest time.
3. **Physics**: Deriving equations of motion in classical mechanics using the principle of least action.

The calculus of variations is foundational in many areas, including mechanics, geometry, and optimization, and it forms the basis of modern fields like optimal control and numerical analysis.
