[[Crystal Lattice]]

The reciprocal lattice of a Bravais lattice is the set of wave-vectors for which a plane wave will be invariant to any translation by the direct lattice vectors. This reciprocal lattice will have all symmetries of the direct lattice. So if the direct is the set $\mathbf{R}$ and the reciprocal $\mathbf{K}$ we must have:
$$
e^{i\mathbf{K}\cdot\mathbf{R}} = \left\{1\right\}
$$

>Thus for [[#^c9cd54]] to hold we need the coordinates of $\mathbf{K}$ over the new basis to be integers.

>If the lattice is 2D, we'll still use the above procedure, "completing" to 3D with $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ the vector perpendicular to the lattice

# BRILLOUIN Zone

The [[Crystal Lattice#^02fae9|Wigner-Seitz primitive cell]] of the reciprocal lattice is known as the first Brillouin zone [ðŸ”–](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I2H7EZCQ?page=111&annotation=KBMV2YC2)

>[!def] Bravais Lattice Plane
>Given a particular Bravais lattice, a lattice plane is defined to be any plane conÂ¬ taining at least three noncollinear Bravais lattice points [ðŸ”–](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I2H7EZCQ?page=112&annotation=CJKWQPTY)

>[!thm] Lattice Plane - Reciprocal Lattice Duality
>For any family of lattice planes separated by a distance d, there are reciprocal lattice vectors perpendicular to the planes, the shortest of which have a length of $\frac{2\pi}{d}$. Conversely, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, there is a family of lattice planes normal to K and separated by a distance d, where:
> $$\frac{2\pi}{d} = \min_{\mathbf{\hat{K}} = \mathbf{\hat{K}'} \in \mathcal{B}} \lvert \lvert \mathbf{K}' \rvert  \rvert $$ is the length of the shortest reciprocal lattice vector parallel to K. [ðŸ”–](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I2H7EZCQ?page=112&annotation=82PZ4N5Z)
