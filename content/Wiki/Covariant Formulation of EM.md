>[!theorem] Gauge Transformation of the four-potential
>When adding a complete differential to the action integral, essentially we're adding a function of the coordinates, s.t. its integral does not depend on the specific path taken, but only on the endpoints. As such, it doesn't affect the variation and the trajectory we get from E-L equations will not change. Equivalently, we can say that adding a differential 
>$$\frac{q}{c}d \chi$$
>Is the same as transforming the field $A_{\mu}  \to A_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}\chi$. This transformation is called a gauge transformation, and the EM tensort is invariant to it

> [!warning] A big advantage of the covariant formulation
> We have identified [[The Electromagnetic Field Tensor]]. A major advantage we get in the covariant formulation, is that we easily find out how the EM fields transform under Lorentz transformations - something we had to work a week for in Classical EM:
> $$F'^{\alpha \beta} = \Gamma^\alpha_{\mu}\Gamma^\beta_{\nu}F^{\mu \nu} = \Gamma F \Gamma^T$$
