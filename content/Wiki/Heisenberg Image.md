In the Heisenberg image, instead of time-propagating the quantum state and having the operators fixed, we propagate the operators and have the quantum states fixed. 
$$\mathcal{O}_{H}\left(t\right)=e^{i H t/\hbar}\mathcal{O}_{S}e^{-i H t/\hbar}$$
By differentiating the triple product over time, we arrive at a PDE that is analogous to [[Hamiltonian Mechanics]] with Poisson brackets, if the Hamiltonian is time independent:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathcal{O}}_{H}\left(t\right)={\frac{1}{i\hbar}}\left[{\mathcal{O}}_{H}\left(t\right),H\right]+\left({\frac{\partial{\mathcal{O}}_{S}}{\partial t}}\right)_{H}$$
